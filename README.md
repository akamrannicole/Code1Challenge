## Code Challenge: JavaScript Solutions

This repository contains JavaScript solutions for three code challenges. Each challenge has its own file within a single folder.

### Prerequisites
1. **Repository Creation**: Create a repository on your GitHub account.
2. **Language Requirement**: Use JavaScript to implement the solutions.
3. **File Structure**: Use one folder, with 3 files for each solution. Each file should hold one solution only.
4. **Pushing Solutions**: Push the solutions to the created repository.
5. **Submission**: Submit the repository link for grading.

### Challenges
#### 1. Student Grade Generator
- **Description**: Prompt the user to input student marks. Output the corresponding grade based on the following criteria:
  - A > 79
  - B - 60 to 79
  - C - 49 to 59
  - D - 40 to 49
  - E - less than 40
- **File**: `StudentGrade.js`

#### 2. Speed Detector
- **Description**: Take as input the speed of a car. If the speed is less than 70, print "Ok". Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points. If the driver gets more than 12 points, print "License suspended".
- **File**: `SpeedDetector.js`

#### 3. Net Salary Calculator
- **Description**: Calculate an individualâ€™s net salary based on the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary.
